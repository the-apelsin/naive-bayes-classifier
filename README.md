# Naive-Bayes Classifier
According to Wikipedia, "naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple "probabilistic classifiers" based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong (naive) independence assumptions between the features (see Bayes classifier). They are among the simplest Bayesian network models,[1] but coupled with kernel density estimation, they can achieve high accuracy levels". This particular classifier uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, please make sure you have it installed according to the comments on the python file.
